            <p>The Research Ethics Guidebook is designed as a resource for&nbsp;social science researchers - those early in their careers, as well as more experienced colleagues.&nbsp; It aims to help you find your way through the variety of regulatory processes and procedures that can apply to social science research - signposting you to more detailed information along the way, and acting as a prompt for reflection and questioning at all stages of the research process.&nbsp;You might use it for:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><em>Your own research...&nbsp; </em>To help you write a&nbsp;research proposal, apply for ethics approval, or deal with ethics dilemmas that arise during a project.</li>
                <li><em>Undergraduate studies...&nbsp; </em>As a resource for students, for research methods assignments or as a basis for tutorial discussions, or in carrying out undergraduate research projects.</li>
                <li><em>Research&nbsp;supervision ...&nbsp; </em>To help your student&nbsp;negotiate ethics at different stages of the research process, and as a tool for reflecting on your responsibilities in relation to ethics in student research.</li>
                <li><em>Staff development...</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; For training of ethics committee members or research supervisors.</li>
            </ul>
